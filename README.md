# Automatic-Object-Rotation-in-Unity
##Script for automatic rotation of cube (or any 3D object) in Unity.

Add a cube (or any 3D object) in Unity. Create four different gameobjects (pos0, pos1, pos2, pos3) and set their position such that it coincides with the position of mid-point of edges of the top-view of cube (or the 3D object).

Adjust the yHeight parameter to get desired output.
